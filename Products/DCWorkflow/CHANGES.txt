2.2.3 (2011-01-12)

  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope-cmf/+bug/625722)


2.2.1 (2010-07-04)
------------------

- Deal with deprecation warnings for Zope 2.13.


2.2.0 (2010-01-04)
------------------

- no changes from version 2.2.0-beta


2.2.0-beta (2009-12-06)
-----------------------

- no changes from version 2.2.0-alpha


2.2.0-alpha (2009-11-13)
------------------------

- moved the Zope dependency to version 2.12.0b3dev

- Worklists: The catalog variable match setting can now be a 
  formatted string (as before), but also a qualified TAL 
  expression, meaning it has a prefix like "string:", "python:".
  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope-cmf/+bug/378292)

- exportimport: Support for instance creation guards and manager 
  bypass added.
  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope-cmf/+bug/308947)

- Cleaned up / normalized imports:

  o Don't import from Globals;  instead, use real locations.

  o Make other imports use the actual source module, rather than an
    intermediate (e.g., prefer importing 'ClassSecurityInfo' from
    'AccessControl.SecurityInfo' rather than from 'AccessControl').

  o Avoid relative imports, which will break in later versions of Python.

- Strip trailing newlines in order to properly match with a msgid when
  translating transition descriptions.

- Workflow UI: Remove ancient cruft to accommodate the proprietary
  (and long dead) base_cms product.

- Worklists and Transitions: Add icon expression properties to worklist
  and transition actions and their GenericSetup profiles.

- Fixed an import error (Products.PageTemplates.TALES is gone on 
  Zope trunk).  Because we require Zope >= 2.10, we don't need a
  BBB conditional import.


2.1.2 (2008-09-13)
------------------

- test fixture: Fix failng tests with GenericSetup > 1.3 by explicitly
  loading GS' meta.zcml during setup.


2.1.2-beta (2008-08-26)
-----------------------

- completed devolution from monolithic CMF package into its component
  products that are distributed as eggs from PyPI.


2.1.1 (2008-01-06)
------------------

- no changes


2.1.1-beta(2007-12/29)
----------------------

- Testing: Derive test layers from ZopeLite layer if available.

- exportimport: Scripts with invalid types imported
  after scripts with valid types will no longer place the valid
  script twice.  Scripts can also now be specified with meta_types
  other than the hard-coded meta_types.

- AfterTransitionEvent now passes along the new status of the
  object, just as StateChangeInfo passes on the new status to
  after-transition scripts.
  (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/490)


2.1.0 (2007-08-08)
------------------

- Fixed all componentregistry.xml files to use plain object paths and strip
  and slashes. GenericSetup does only support registering objects which are
  in the site root.


2.1.0-beta2 (2007-07-12)
------------------------

- moved the Zope dependency to version 2.10.4

- Remove antique usage of marker attributes in favor of interfaces,
  leaving BBB behind for places potentially affecting third-party code.
  (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/440)

- Add POST-only protections to security critical methods.
  http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-0240)

- Workflow definition instances now have a description field
  (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/480)

  http://svn.zope.org/CMF/branches/2.1/docs/ToolsAreUtilities.stx?view=auto

- Merged patches from Martin Aspeli to enable generating events before
  and after DCWorkflow transitions, and in the 'notify' methods of the
  workflow tool (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/461).

------------------------

  Now getBrowserCharset is used to play nice with Five forms. Customized
  setRedirect and getMainGlobals scripts have to be updated.

- Profiles: All profiles are now registered by ZCML.

- ZClasses: Removed unmaintained support for ZClasses.
  Marked the 'initializeBases*' methods as deprecated.

- Content: Added IFactory utilities for all content classes.
